# Image Generation Prompt: URI Axioms of Web Architecture

## Main Prompt Concept

Create a visual diagram illustrating the axioms of Web architecture (URIs as universal identifiers) with interconnected nodes, flowing connections, and hierarchical structures representing global scope, identity, and opacity.

## Core Visual Elements to Include

- **Central URI representation** - Could be a glowing orb, geometric shape, or symbolic icon
- **Hierarchical connections** - Tree structure, slash-separated paths, nested levels
- **Global scope visualization** - Encompassing sphere or globe-spanning network
- **Identity/sameness** - Mirrored or repeated elements showing consistent reference
- **Opacity** - Featureless containers or wrapped/unwrapped comparison
- **GET operation** - Retrieval symbol without side effects, pure observation
- **Relative URI paths** - Short connections showing local references within hierarchy
- **Multiple schemes** - Different visual styles for http, ftp, mailto, etc.
