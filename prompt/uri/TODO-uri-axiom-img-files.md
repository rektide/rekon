- Steel stamping as mass production
- Bronze casting as archival permanence
- CNC machining as automated generation
- Welded sculptures as permanent joins

## Key Concepts to Weave Into Each Theme

### From URI Axioms:
- Universality (Axiom 0): Anything can have a URI
- Global Scope (Axiom 1): Same meaning everywhere
- Sameness (Axiom 2a): Repeatable reference to same thing
- Identity (Axiom 2b): Owner determines significance
- Opacity: URIs as opaque strings, not to be parsed for meaning
- No side effects (GET semantics)
- Hierarchical structure enabling relative URIs
- First Class Objects (FCOs)

### From Cool URIs:
- Persistence over time
- What makes a URI cool (doesn't change)
- Why URIs change (human decisions, not technical necessity)
- Reputation damage from broken links
- What to leave out (author names, status, file extensions, software mechanisms)
- Domain name considerations
- Design for longevity (2, 20, 200 years)

## Writing Strategy

For each file:
1. Open with theme concept overview
2. For each sub-prompt:
   - Start with visual description
   - Connect to specific URI axiom(s)
   - Connect to Cool URI principle(s)
   - Elaborate metaphorical connections
   - Discuss visual elements that reinforce concepts
3. Include cross-theme connections where relevant
4. Use markdown with headers, bullet points, and visual descriptions
5. Aim for rich, evocative language that inspires visual generation

## Priorities
1. nature-and-organic.md (minimum 5 sections - GO DEEP)
2. architectural-and-monumental.md (persistent structures)
3. cosmic-and-scientific.md (universal principles)
4. All others with equal depth and care
